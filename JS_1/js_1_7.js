// The sintax in the for loops is not like in Python:
// for(var variable = init_value; stop_condition; variable = variable_step){
//     code to execute in each iteration
// }
// if the variable is a String, you use for/in to deal with it.
// if the variable is an Array, you use for/of to deal with it.
